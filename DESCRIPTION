Title: Create Iterators From Sequential Code
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Peter",
           family = "Meilstrup",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "peter.meilstrup@gmail.com")
Description: A generator is written using familiar sequential constructs like
             `for` and `while` loops. This code is turned into an iterator that
             is run incrementally. The iterator produces a value and pauses for
             each time its generator code reaches a `yield()` call.
