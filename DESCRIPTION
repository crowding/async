Title: Create Iterators and Promises From Sequential Code
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Peter",
           family = "Meilstrup",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "peter.meilstrup@gmail.com")
Description: A generator is written using sequential constructs like `for` and `while`
             loops. This code is turned into an iterator that can be paused and
             resumed where it left off. The iterator yields a value and pauses for
             each time its inner code executes a `yield()` call. The package also allows
             defining promise objects using sequential code that executes in-thread.
