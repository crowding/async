# A Musical Introduction to Generators

What a generator allows you to do is to take code that is writen in
a sequential, looping style, and then treat that code's output as
a collection to be iterated over.

To illustrate what this means, and the the generators package in
general, I will use R to perform a suitable piece of music,
specifically Steve Reich's "Clapping Music."

The piece is starts with a loop counting out groups of 3, 2, 1, 2, 3,
2, 1, 2, 3... with each group seperated by one rest. In musical
notion, this makes a 12-count loop:

![Musical score showing loop](clapping_music.svg)

In code, we could implement that idea like the following, printing a
`1` for each clap and a `0` for each rest:

```{R}
print_pattern <- function(counts = c(3, 2, 1, 2)) {
    for (c in counts) {
        for (j in 1:c)
          cat(1)
        cat(0)
    }
}
```

Testing this, we should see groups of 1, 2, or 3 `1`s separated by a single  `0`:
```{R}
for (i in 1:4) print_pattern(); cat("\n")
```

"Clapping Music" is based on manipulating this 12-count loop. But as
written, it's hard to manipulate the output of this program. The calls
to `cat` produce output on the terminal, but they don't produce data
that we can easily manipulate with more programming -- we need to make
this pattern into data, rather than terminal output.

A typical way to proceed would be to rewrite `pattern` so that it
allocates an output vector, whose size would be calculated in advance,
then place each note into the appropriate place in the output. There
would need to be another index variable to track the output index,
since the output index corresponds to neither `c` nor `j`.

But we can avoid dealing with that indexing by using a generator. To
do this, enclose the body of the function in a call to `gen()`, and
change each `cat()` to `yield()` to return the values.

```{R}
gen_pattern <- function(counts = c(3, 2, 1, 2)) { force(counts)
  generators::gen({
    for (n in itertools::recycle(counts)) {
      for (j in 1:n)
        yield(1)
      yield(0)
    }
  })
}
```

The code inside `gen(...)` does not run, yet. The call to `gen`
constructs an iterator, as defined by the `iterators` package, which
supports the method `nextElem`. When `nextElem()` is called on a
generator, the generator runs its code only up to the point where
`yield` is called. The generator returns this value, and saves its
state until the next time it is called.

```{R}
p <- gen_pattern()
cat(nextElem(p), "\n")
cat(nextElem(p), "\n")
cat(nextElem(p), "\n")
cat(nextElem(p), "\n")
for (i in 1:23) { cat(nextElem(p)) }; cat("\n")
```

Note that `gen_pattern` has a call to `itertools` call in its
for-loop. In a generator you can go ahead and put an iterator (or
anything which has an `iter` method) into the for-loop argument.
Outside of a generator, this would require using something other than
a `for` loop, such as the `foreach` package. So a for-loop is running
over an indefinitely long sequence.


Having made an iterator by exchanging `cat` for `yield`, we can now
use iterator functions to collect and display the output:

```{R}
show_head <- function(x, n=24) {
  x %>% itertools::ilimit(n) %>% as.list %>% deparse() %>% cat(sep="\n")
}
show_head(gen_pattern(), 24)
```

## Making sounds

We're a good way into what I advertised as a musical endeavour and
haven't made any sounds yet, so let's address that, with a generator,
of course. `with_sound()` will take an iterator as input, and it will
return a new iterator which plays a sound for each nonzero number it
passes through.

```{R}
with_sound <- function(g, paths) { list(g, paths)
  samples <- lapply(paths, audio::load.wave)
  #samples <- lapply(samples, function(x) x[1:20000])
  print(names(paths))
  generators::gen({
    for (x in g) {
      if(is.numeric(x) && x >= 1 && x <= length(samples)) {
        cat(x)
        audio::play(samples[[x]])
        cat(names(paths)[x])
      } else {
        cat(".")
      }
      yield(x)
    }
    cat("\n")
  })
}
```

We'll also need a couple of handclap samples, one for single claps and
one for double claps. Let's download some I found on Github:

```{R}
tmp <- tempdir()
baseurl <- "https://github.com/octoblu/drum-kit/raw/master/public/assets/samples"
samplepaths <- paste0(tmp, c("x" = "/clap4.wav","X" = "/clap5.wav"))
curl::curl_download(paste0(baseurl, "/clap%20(4).WAV"), samplepaths[1])
curl::curl_download(paste0(baseurl, "/clap%20(5).WAV"), samplepaths[2])
```

So you should hear two different sounds here:

```{R}
g <- generators::gen({yield(1); yield(2)}) %>% with_sound(samplepaths)
invisible(nextElem(g))
invisible(nextElem(g))
```

---

Here's a couple of utility functions we'll need for the next bit. One
is an equivalent of `lapply` for iterators, which I'll call
`iter_map`. The other one is `sink` which just consumes all elements
from an iterator.

```r
iter_map <- function(it, f, ...) {  list(it, f, ...)
  generators::gen(for (x in it) yield(f(x, ...)))
}
sink <- function(x) {
  tryCatch(repeat last <- nextElem(x),
           error=function(e)
             if (!identical(conditionMessage(e), 'StopIteration')) stop(e))
  invisible(last)
}
```

Back to making sounds.  If we let the generators run at fast as they
could, the sound played wouldn't be intelligible. We need to set a
tempo. So here is a generator function which passes its input to its
output at a specified rate.

```r
with_tempo <- function(g, bpm) {  list(g, bpm) #force
  interval <- 60 / bpm
  generators::gen({
    target <- Sys.time()
    for (i in g) {
      yield(i)
      target <- target + interval
      now <- Sys.time()
      if (target - now > 0.15) Sys.sleep(target - now - 0.15)
      profvis::pause(target - Sys.time()) #for better precision
    }
  })
}
```

So this should print numbers at a regular interval:

```r
iter(1:20) %>% with_tempo(180) %>% iter_map(cat) %>% sink
```

Now we are ready to hear the rhythm, by pipelining our
pattern through our noisemaker and metronome.

```r
gen_pattern() %>% with_sound(samplepaths) %>% with_tempo(320) %>%
  itertools::ilimit(48) %>% sink
```

## Phasing and combining

"Clapping Music" is a piece for two performers, who both play the same
pattern, but after every 12 loops, one of the performers skips forward
by one step, so that over the course of the piece, the two parts move
out and in phase with each other. A generator function models the
occasional skip nicely, by consuming a value without yielding it:

```r
drop_one_after <- function(g, n, sep) {  list(g, n)
  generators::gen(
    repeat {
      for (i in 1:n) yield(iterators::nextElem(g))
      iterators::nextElem(g) #drop
      if(!missing(sep)) cat(sep)
    }
  )
}
```
Here, illustrated with a count that skips one after emitting three -- that is,
dropping every fourth item (and printing a newline.)

```r
iterators::icount() %>% itertools::ilimit(12) %>% drop_one_after(3, "\n") %>%
  iter_map(cat, "") %>% sink
```

Now, we can make two generators, have one of them skip some beats, and
add them together:

```r
clapping_music <- function(n=12, sep="") {
  a <- gen_pattern(c(3,2,1,2))
  b <- gen_pattern(c(3,2,1,2)) %>% drop_one_after(n*12, sep)
  both <- itertools::izip(a, b) %>% iter_map(function(x) x[[1]] + x[[2]])
  itertools::ilimit(both, 13*12*n)
}
```

To narrate this: we are constructing two independent instances
of our basic 12-beat `XXX.XX.X.XX.` pattern. One of these patterns is
made to skip one beat every N bars. These two loops are then combined
in parallel with `izip` then `iter_map` to add the values together
giving a count of 0, 1, or 2 for each beat.

```r
clapping_music(4, "\n") %>% iter_map(cat) %>% sink
```

## A performance

Now all that's needed is to pipe this through a noisemaker.

```r
clapping_music(12) %>%
  with_tempo(320) %>%
  with_sound(samplepaths) %>%
  sink
```

R is definitely not a multimedia environment, plus the `audio` package
is using the OS alert sound facility, which is not designed for
precise timing, so I can hear some glitches and pauses on
occasion. However this does illustrate some of the things you can do
with generators; how he generators package allows control to be
_interleaved_ among different sequential processes -- here, 

Generators allow you to escape from obligatory collection-thinking, to
express with sequential code that which is best represented that way,
and work at the level of collections and iterators when that is most
convenient.

# Appendix: alternate implemntations of `pattern`

[appendix]: I mentioned above that implementing `pattern` to output a vector
involves extra calculations and maintenance of index variables. Here's the
example, with `gen_pattern` repeated for comparison.

```{R}
gen_pattern <- function(counts = c(3, 2, 1, 2)) { force(counts)
  generators::gen({
    for (n in itertools::recycle(counts)) {
      for (j in 1:n)
        yield(1)
      yield(0)
    }
  })
}

vec_pattern <- function(counts = c(3,2,1,2)) {
  out <- vector(mode="numeric", length=sum(counts) + length(counts))
  ix = 1
  for (c in counts) {
    out[ix:(ix+c-1)] <- 1
    ix <- ix + c + 1
  }
  out
}
```

On the other hand, here's what `gen_pattern` would look like if you
directly implemented it as an iterator.  It requires some state
variables that `nextElem` closes over, as well as some work to check
and update those variables using `<<-`.

```{R}
iter_pattern <- function(counts=c(3,2,1,2)) {
  counts <- itertools::recycle(iter(counts))
  c <- 0
  gi <- 1
  itertools::new_iterator(function() {
    c <- nextElem(counts)
    if (gi <= c) {
      gi <<- gi + 1
      return(1)
    } else {
      ci <<- ci + 1
      gi <- 1
      return(0)
    }
  })
}
```

This is because we can't use `for`, `if`, and such to directly track
state; because an iterator always has to return from nextElem. it has
to maintain its state by hand. This is unfortunate because, as the
designers of ALGOL originally found in their research, constructs like
`if`, `repeat`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, are very useful for
describing common patterns in state machines! Another way to think
about what the `generators` packageis doing is implementing a
domain-specific language for iterators -- where the DSL is built to
act a lot like the host language.
