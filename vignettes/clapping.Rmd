# A Musical Introduction to Generators

What a generator allows you to do is to take code that is writen in
a sequential, looping style, and then treat that code's output as
a collection to be iterated over.

To illustrate what this means, and the the generators package in
general, I will use R to perform a suitable piece of music,
specifically Steve Reich's "Clapping Music."

The piece is starts with a loop counting out groups of 3, 2, 1, 2, 3,
2, 1, 2, 3... with each group seperated by one rest. This adds up to a
12-note loop:

![Musical score showing loop](clapping_music.svg)

In code, we could implement that idea like the following, printing a
`1` for each clap and a `0` for each rest:

```{R}
print_pattern <- function(counts = c(3, 2, 1, 2), repeats=4) {
  for (i in seq_len(repeats)) {
    for (c in counts) {
        for (j in 1:c)
          cat(1)
        cat(0)
    }
  }
  cat("\n")
}
```

Testing this, we should see groups of 1, 2, or 3 `1`s separated by a single `0`:
```{R}
print_pattern(repeats=4);
```

"Clapping Music" is based on manipulating this 12-count loop. But it's hard to
manipulate the output of a program that only prints. The calls
to `cat` produce output on the terminal, but they don't produce data
that we can easily manipulate with more programming -- we need to make
this pattern into data, rather than terminal output.

The `generators` package allows us to enclose a data-generating process into an
object.

To make a generator for this patter, we just enclose the body of the
function in a call to `gen()`, and change each `cat()` to `yield()`.

```{R}
library(async) # for gen
gen_pattern <- function(counts = c(3, 2, 1, 2)) { force(counts)
  gen({
    repeat {
      for (n in counts) {
        for (j in 1:n)
          yield(1)
        yield(0)
      }
    }
  })
}
```

Adding `force(counts)` is a good idea because of R's lazy evaluation +
mutable bindings.  A generator captures its environment like an inner
function, so it's a good idea to fix the value of `counts` before the
outer function returns; this is the same as if you return an inner
function that uses arguments to an outer function. Meanwhile, fixing
the number of `repeats` ahead of time is no longer necessary; a
generator can be in principle infinite and it will only generate data
as long as you keep requesting more.

The code inside `gen(...)` does not run, yet. The call to `gen`
constructs an
[iterator][iterators::iterators-package],
which supports the method `nextElem`. When `nextElem()` is called on a
generator, the generator runs its code only up to the point where
`yield` is called. The generator returns this value, and pauses state
until the next call to `nextElem()`.

```{R}
library(iterators)
p <- gen_pattern()
for (i in 1:23) { cat(nextElem(p)) }; cat("\n")
```

`gen(...)` constructs and returns an
[iterator](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iterators),
which means you can apply iterator methods to it. For instance you can collect
just the first 24 items with `ilimit()`:

```{R}
library(magrittr)
show_head <- function(x, n=24) {
  x %>% itertools::ilimit(n) %>% as.list() %>% deparse() %>% cat(sep="\n")
}
show_head(gen_pattern(), 24)
```

## Making noise

We're a good way into what I advertised as a musical endeavour and
haven't made any sounds yet. First let's download some handclap
samples. I located some on GitHub:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
tmp <- tempdir()
baseurl <- "https://github.com/octoblu/drum-kit/raw/master/public/assets/samples"
samplepaths <- paste0(tmp, c("x" = "/clap4.wav","X" = "/clap5.wav"))
curl::curl_download(paste0(baseurl, "/clap%20(4).WAV"), samplepaths[1])
curl::curl_download(paste0(baseurl, "/clap%20(5).WAV"), samplepaths[2])
```

Although R is not known for audio performance, there is an `audio`
package playing sound samples, which we can use like this:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
library(audio) # for load.wave, play
claps <- lapply(samplepaths, load.wave)
play(claps[[1]])
play(claps[[2]])
```

We want to play sounds at a consistent tempo, so here's a routine that
takes in a generator and a sample list, and plays at a given
tempo. The `profvis` package has a `pause` function that's more
accurate than `Sys.sleep()`.

```r
library(profvis) # for pause
iplay <- function(g, samples, bpm) {
  interval <- 60 / bpm
  target <- Sys.time()
  tryCatch(
    repeat {
      x <- nextElem(g)
      target <- target + interval
      while({now <- Sys.time(); Sys.time() - now > 0.15})
        Sys.sleep(target - now - 0.15)
      if (is.numeric(x) && x >= 1 && x <= length(samples)) {
        cat(x)
        pause(target - Sys.time())
        play(samples[[x]])
      } else {
        cat(".")
      }
    },
    error=function(e) {
      if (identical(conditionMessage(e), 'StopIteration'))
        invisible(NULL)
      else stop(e)
    })
}
```

So we should hear our pattern now:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
gen_pattern() %>% itertools::ilimit(36) %>% iplay(claps, 360)
```

### Some iterator functions

Here's a couple of utility functions that will come in handy. One
is an iterator equivalent of `lapply` for iterators, which I'll call
`iapply`. The other one is `isink` which just consumes all elements
from an iterator.

```r
iapply <- function(it, f, ...) { list(it, f, ...)
  itertools::new_iterator(function() {
    f(nextElem(it), ...)
  })
}

isink <- function(it, then=invisible(NULL)) {
  tryCatch(
    repeat {nextElem(it)},
    error=function(e) {
      if (!identical(conditionMessage(e), 'StopIteration'))
        stop(e)
    })
 then
}
```

### Some iterator functions using generators

Note that in a generator, you can write a `for` loop with an iterator
in the argument. So we can equivalently write `iapply` and `isink` like this:

```r
iapply <- function(it, f, ...) { list(it, f, ...)
  gen({
    for (x in it) yield(f(x, ...))
  })
}
```

```r
isink <- function(it, then=NULL) {
  gen({
    for (i in it) next
    yield(then)
  }) %>% nextElem() %>% invisible()
}
```

For example, run an iterator through `iapply(cat)` and `isink` to print it:

```r
g <- gen_pattern() |> itertools::ilimit(24) |> iapply(cat) |> isink(cat("\n"))
```

## Phasing and combining

"Clapping Music" is a piece for two performers, who both play the same
pattern, but after every 12 loops, one of the performers skips forward
by one step. Over the course of the piece, the two parts move out and
back into in phase with each other. We can write a generator function
that does this "skip," by consuming a value without yielding it:

```{R}
drop_one_after <- function(g, n, sep=character(0)) {  list(g, n, sep)
  gen(
    repeat {
      for (i in 1:n) yield(nextElem(g))
      nextElem(g) #drop
      cat(sep) # print a seperator after every skip
    }
  )
}
```

Here's a count from one to 12, skipping after three (i.e. skipping every fourth):

```r
iterators::icount() %>%
itertools::ilimit(12) %>%
drop_one_after(3, "\n") %>%
iapply(cat, "") %>%
isink()
```

The performance directions for "Clapping Music" request that the two
performers should make their claps sound similar, so that their lines
blend into an overall pattern. We can interpret that as combining the
two lines by adding two generators, resulting in 0, 1, or 2 claps at
every step, playing the louder sample for a value of 2.

Then, all together:

```r
clapping_music <- function(n=12, counts=c(3,2,1,2), sep=" ") {
  cell <- sum(counts+1) # how long?
  a <- gen_pattern(counts)
  b <- gen_pattern(counts) %>% drop_one_after(n*cell, sep)
  # add them together and limit the output
  gen(for (i in 1:(n*(cell+1)*cell)) {
    yield(nextElem(a) + nextElem(b))
  })
}
```

To narrate this: we are constructing two independent instances of our
12-note generator. One of these patterns is made to skip one beat every N
bars. Then we create a third generator that adds together the two.

```r
clapping_music(4, sep="\n") %>% iapply(cat) %>% isink(cat("\n"))
```

## A performance

Now we should be able to hear our performance

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iplay(clapping_music(n=4, sep="\n"), claps, 480)
```

R is definitely not a multimedia environment, plus the `audio` package
is using the OS alert sound facility, which is not really meant for
precise timing, so you may hear some glitches and hiccups. Nevertheless,
I hope this has illustrated how generators allows control to be
_interleaved_ among different sequential processes.
