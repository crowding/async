## Fixing "switch"

The current CPS version does not do branch fallthrough. To fix that I
would need to know during construction which arguments are missing.

R native "switch" does a thing where it can end up executing no arguments.

    switch(-1, "one", "two", "three") #takes no branch and returns NULL.

That behavior would be bad to use base R switch as a compiled version of switch, because it would end up falling off and not tailcalling.

Let's see, what about if you initialize a "mapping" at run time and then switch based on a label you pull out of there?

# ESS versus closxps?!

Apparently the reason I can't just tag a "class" attribute onto a closxp and call that an iteror is.... ESS is fucking with me. If I evaluate a chunk in ESS, it is altering the environment of the resulting closxp. it comes back with the enclosing environment set to the package namespace, instead of the environment that _really_ enclosed it and has its variables. It's weird.

# Name munging

### duplication of trace() and such

Okay, I apparently left off in the midst of munging names. Judging from where I left the `browser()` call, I was finding an argument that transfers "state variables" except that these variables are never updated. If they are never updated then I should be able to dedupe them. But not deduping them will not prevent me from reaching proof of concept with compilation. Deduping of unused variables is a future problem.

However, the other problem with porting over utility variables is what variables are they closed over with? So one resolution might be to treat local functions found in non tail position as a kind of node, and thus capture the variables it itself refers to? Hopefully this doesn't lead to infinite regress? This would be at graph enumeration time.

### Switch in graphs

I need to do something tricky to make my implementation of `switch` traversable by `walk`. Like bquote() out a custom switch_cps. See [switch.R]().

### Speed of walking the graph.

There did appear to be some O(N^2) rearing their heads when walk()ing a graph. Run a profiler? There are definitely some O(n^2) data structures currently in there.

I did something to make myself use hashbags more consistently and noticed a speedup! So there was def some list reallocation going on.

Interestingly, using a list by index isn't much slower than using an env until you get past 100 elements or so. (see ) But s3 dispatch and going through `hashbag()` is quite a bit slower. See [map_timings.Rmd](). So I might want to just use lists instead of hashbags. If I can keep them from having to copy themselves all the time.

## Emacs locking up when I pause in R debugger

Aargh, something is happening in ess-mode that makes emacs lock up waiting for a response when it's in the debugger. Can be triggered by ess-whatever-completions mode. Is triggered by just having point in an R buffer for a few seconds.

ESS output window keeps saying "Disabling output delimiter because CMD failed to parse."

## it would be nice if name-munging twice were idempotent.

(i.e. ended up with the names and translated functions.) One way to do
that might be to not bother slapping context on the names of nodes in
the special "first" context encountered.)

## Refactor so that trampoline handlers do not use `...` but either take a value or not..

Okay, this `...` business in the handlers might be getting silly. I think for sanity's sake I might have to declare some trampolines take a `val` and others don't. That will be another refactoring (probably before I do codegen)

## Awaiting on a "pr" that doesn't exist gives a "subscript out of bounds"

In this:

      async({
        tryCatch({
          if (await(pr)) {
            return(5)
            not_run <<- FALSE
            5
          } else 4
        }, finally={
          cleanup <<- TRUE
        })
      }

It _should_ give a more comprehensible error. This particular error sounds like something wrong with tryCatch.

## better context/node labels

Would aid debugging comprehension if context / node labels followed the syntax tree more,
were like (try.body.1, try.body,3, try.catch.R) and the like.
