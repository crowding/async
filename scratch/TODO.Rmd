# ESS versus closxps?!

Apparently the reason I can't just tag a "class" attribute onto a closxp and call that an iteror is.... ESS is fucking with me. If I evaluate a chunk in ESS, it is altering the environment of the resulting closxp. it comes back with the enclosing environment set to the package namespace, instead of the environment that _really_ enclosed it and has its variables. It's weird.


## Emacs locking up when I pause in R debugger

Aargh, something is happening in ess-mode that makes emacs lock up waiting for a response when it's in the debugger. Can be triggered by ess-whatever-completions mode. Is triggered by just having point in an R buffer for a few seconds.

ESS output window keeps saying "Disabling output delimiter because CMD failed to parse."

This is likely because all my variable names in the compiled generators are fucky.

## it would be nice if name-munging twice were idempotent.

(i.e. ended up with the names and translated functions.) One way to do
that might be to not bother slapping context on the names of nodes in
the special "first" context encountered.)

## Debugging tools

Make some methods that allow single stepping the R code, as well as to allow single stepping the "interior" code.

Setting "debugOnce" on pumpCont (whenever it's updated) would do it.

And an option for user-level stepping, evaluating "browser()" in the
target environment and single stepping.

Meanwhile, it might be good to do R's "eval" via a handler, so as to condense references to the target environment.

## display of handlers in graphs

make a custom node style for handlers, or maybe an out-and-back edge?

An edge to a node in the middle of a trampoline edge might work too.

Hey maybe rewrite drawGraph() in collector style?
