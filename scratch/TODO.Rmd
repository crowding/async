# basic generator should run without windups

Now that we have iteror() we should go through generator and make sure that it
doesn't unnecessarily invoke any tryCatch.

# Fixing "switch"

The current CPS version does not do branch fallthrough. To fix that I
would need to know during construction which arguments are missing.

R native "switch" does a thing where it can end up executing no arguments. I

switch(-1, "one", "two", "three") takes no branch and returns NULL.

That behavior would be bad to use base R switch as a compiled version of switch, because it would end up falling off and not tailcalling.

Let's see, what about if you initialize a "mapping" at run time and then switch based on a label you pull out of there?

# making arguments "quotable"

Some constructors might want to get the "quoted" arguments of stuff they aren't going to evaluate. How?


# ESS versus closxps?!

Apparently the reason I can't just tag a "class" attribute onto a closxp and call that an iteror is.... ESS is fucking with me. If I evaluate a chunk in ESS, it is altering the environment of the resulting closxp. it comes back with the enclosing environment set to the package namespace, instead of the environment that _really_ enclosed it and has its variables. It's weird.
